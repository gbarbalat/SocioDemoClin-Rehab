# SocioDemoClin-Rehab

This project aims to investigate the potential for socio-demographic (age, sex, employment etc ...) and basis clinical predictors (clinical severity, global assessment of functioning, clinical history) to predict rehabilitation outcomes (such as various aspects of quality of life, autonomy, self-esteem, self-stigmatisation, adherence to treatment, insight).  
In other words, the project aims at answering the following research question: 
Do rehabilitation outcomes depend on characteristics that are usually measured in clinical settings?  
If so, it may suggest that rehabilitation is yet another clinical outcome. If not however, then this may suggest that there is something specific to rehabilitation compared to other clinical outcomes. And that rehabilitation programs benefit from sub-specialization.  

To investigate this question, we will use a predictive modelling strategy.  
Specifically, we will use an ensemble machine learning algorithm of multiple basis learner to investigate whether socio-demographic and basic clinical characteristics influence rehab outcomes.
