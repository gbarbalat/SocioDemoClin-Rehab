# SocioDemoClin-Rehab

This project investigates whether socio-demographic factors (such as age, sex, employment status) and basic clinical predictors (including clinical severity, global assessment of functioning, and clinical history) can predict rehabilitation outcomes. These outcomes include various aspects of quality of life, autonomy, self-esteem, self-stigmatization, adherence to treatment, and insight.

Research Question:
Do rehabilitation outcomes depend on characteristics that are typically measured in clinical settings?

If the answer is yes, this would suggest that rehabilitation outcomes are similar to other clinical outcomes and may be predicted using standard clinical and demographic variables.

If the answer is no, it may indicate that rehabilitation outcomes are distinct from traditional clinical outcomes, highlighting the need for specialized approaches and potentially supporting the value of sub-specialized rehabilitation programs.

Methodology
To address this question, we will employ a predictive modeling strategy using ensemble machine learning techniques. Specifically, we will use a SuperLearner approach, combining multiple base learners to assess whether socio-demographic and basic clinical characteristics can reliably predict rehabilitation outcomes.
